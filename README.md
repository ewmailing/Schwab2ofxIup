# Schwab2ofx

This is a simple GUI front end for Schwab2ofx using IUP (uses native platform GUI). Because it uses native GUI, the app is launches extremely fast and uses almost no RAM.

This uses https://github.com/ewmailing/Schwab2ofx as a subtree.

# Usage

Click the "Choose Schwab JSON File" button to select the JSON file you downloaded from your Schwab account. It will output an OFX file in the same directory.

The app is associated to recognize the .json file extension, so for Mac, you can also drag-and-drop the JSON file onto the Dock icon.


# Build process

The build process leverages Blurrr SDK.
